# v3 branch

This was the long standing version 3 of our website. As of 2019 October 30'th, It has been retired, and this branch serves only to archive it.

With time, however, It slowly became less and less maintained, and fell very out of date. Code and additions were simply tacked on, and it pretty much just fell from glory.

Now that we're using github, that won't happen again.
