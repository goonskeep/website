      <p>Welcome to the goon's keep, minion.</p>
      <p>We're in the middle of our halloween event, the All Gooners' Eve! Learn about it below.</p>
    </div>
    <h3 class="center-header o">Spooky Bullet Points...</h3>
    <div class="space-between-row align-items-unset">
      <ul>
        <li>The batteries to all of our walkie talkies ran out, and we forgot to order new ones.
          <ul>
            <li>Locational/Proximity Voice Chat is Enabled</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Some local cultists have managed to fuck up gravity... Something about binding it to life forces?
          <ul>
            <li>Gravity fades away with each consecutive death during a round</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>We released a bio-agent into the atmosphere. It doesn't seem to effect the living like we had hoped, but it
          eats away at anything already dead! That's something, right?
          <ul>
            <li>corpses quickly rot and decay to the point
              of being skeletal, after which they can't be identified</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Use <code>playermodel_selector</code> in console to select your model!<br>Or bind it to a key
          with <code>bind "c" "playermodel_selector"</code>, c being the key you want to bind it to.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
