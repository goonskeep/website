      <h3 style="margin-top:0">amber's secret tips..</h3>
      <p>hello there! it's dangerous to go alone, take these tips...</p>
      <ul>
        <li>prop flying is allowed as long as you're within bounds and can be shot down</li>
        <li>prop killing is allowed, as long as you're conforming to our rules (such as no rdm) it is a valid method of
          dealing damage</li>
        <li>the gravity gun can pick up the rollermine, allowing you to provide yourself a semi-unbreakable prop. it can
          still be destroyed, however, by water/guns/explosions</li>
        <li>the gravity gun can pick up a wide variety of unusual things, like bodies and live grenades</li>
        <li>i recommend you give the traitor weapons you're unfamiliar with a chance</li>
        <li>the tau cannon's charged shot can be used similar to rocket jumping in tf2</li>
        <li>the famas is very consistent for short to mid range with it's high fire rate and low recoil</li>
        <li>the rifle's headshot damage bonus applies outside of zoom, so it can be used up close and personal just as
          effectively</li>
        <li>the pistol is underappreciated, headshots are extremely effective</li>
        <li>the traitor's super shotgun is legitimately unbalanced and overpowered</li>
        <li>we have the VSS rather than an awp, but it's actually much better and more balanced for several reasons.
          It's a more stealty proper sniper rifle that rewards headshots.</li>
        <li>most people forget that they have access to a flashlight in this game, use it in dark areas</li>
      </ul>
